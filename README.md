Miso is an AI bot that detects ***misogynistic and harmful*** comments made on messaging platforms!

In professional communication spacesâ€“especially Discord for new startups, Miso ensures that HR is informed of misogynistic and toxic behaviour from employees.
Ultimately, we hope to ***reduce misogyny within tech communities*** so that women feel more empowered to work in STEM!

This was the winner of the University of Toronto's Hackathon prize for best hack to promote female empowerment in STEM!
