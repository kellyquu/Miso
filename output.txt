Did you ask for her social afterwards?,False
This doesn't look like a success.... Regardless of whether she has a bf or not she is not interested. You should of dropped it and not insist that is creepy. She didn't even wanted to be friends so i don't see the point here. She probably just wanted another Instagram follower and hoped you won't bother her lol.,False
Its a success regardless because he tried. People are way too tied into results. Once he does this enough he will get there,False
It isnt success if trying is overridden by being creepy. Yes there is an effort but in a bad sense ,False
Asking to have coffee as friends is not unhealthy or insisting. Who knows how she felt about it. Clearly this is a starting point. Its better than not doing anything and sitting around wondering what wouldve happened. Yes this wasnt a good approach to it and I always think connecting with a girl on a human level must come first before asking them out,False
Look I am okay with trying cold approach that is good practice nothing wrong with that. However if you turn interactions to this it would not go anywhere and you mess up all the effort you put. You basically can cut it when you supposed to and don't leave other party in stress and don't waste time yourself. Simple as that. This is bad for both parties. Asking a coffee as a friend is just plain lie and both parties know about it. So let's pass that.,False
What part of it is creepy? He just did 2 questions. How is that insisting dude?,False
2,False
Yeah I mean trying and such as I said in my other response is good practice and definitely confident booster. However being pushy just spoils that. It wastes further time for you and you can creep others. So not good. Well I haven't been there but If she has rejected him 2 times it doesn't sound like she been comfortable. If she has boyfriend you as stranger pretty much have what to talk her about? She isn't interested romantically which she mentioned. So then you turn and say as friend 1) that looks needy. 2) no one ever would believe that after that point even if you changed your mind. She would always question your intentions hence she plain rejected that option too. Then finally somehow she gave ig which is low risk. She can block him if she wants to. Plus girls care a lot about Instagram followers these days ( lame but true ). Anyway OP try what you trying ( cold approach ) but be sensible on people's boundaries please.,False
