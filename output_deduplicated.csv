1514,Did you ask for her social afterwards?,False
1515,This doesn't look like a success.... Regardless of whether she has a bf or not she is not interested. You should of dropped it and not insist that is creepy. She didn't even wanted to be friends so i don't see the point here. She probably just wanted another Instagram follower and hoped you won't bother her lol.,False

Yes this wasnt a good approach to it and I always think connecting with a girl on a human level must come first before asking them out,False
1519,Look I am okay with trying cold approach that is good practice nothing wrong with that. However if you turn interactions to this it would not go anywhere and you mess up all the effort you put. You basically can cut it when you supposed to and don't leave other party in stress and don't waste time yourself. Simple as that. This is bad for both parties. Asking a coffee as a friend is just plain lie and both parties know about it. So let's pass that.,False
1520,What part of it is creepy? He just did 2 questions. How is that insisting dude?,False
1522,Yeah I mean trying and such as I said in my other response is good practice and definitely confident booster. However being pushy just spoils that. It wastes further time for you and you can creep others. So not good. Well I haven't been there but If she has rejected him 2 times it doesn't sound like she been comfortable. If she has boyfriend you as stranger pretty much have what to talk her about? She isn't interested romantically which she mentioned. So then you turn and say as friend 1) that looks needy. 2) no one ever would believe that after that point even if you changed your mind. She would always question your intentions hence she plain rejected that option too. Then finally somehow she gave ig which is low risk. She can block him if she wants to. Plus girls care a lot about Instagram followers these days ( lame but true ). Anyway OP try what you trying ( cold approach ) but be sensible on people's boundaries please.,False

2173,No I do not believe you sre rewarding anyone but yourself. Your reply comes a bit mysoginistic. Getting with a woman when none of the two parties is interested is just a waste of time.

2286,I'm not sure what number you tried but I was able to get through on Friday using the number on their website (413) 256-2889 . It was a bit annoying because I had to go through several machine prompts and let them play all the way through before it gave me the option to talk to a person.

2350,I feel this way sometimes and really want to keep eating fresh veggies and fruits as long as possible so I signed up for an imperfect produce box delivery every week. You can even add on things like bread and eggs. Im going to get that as long as I can to make the stockpile go further. Obviously I will disinfect everything that is delivered. There are a lot of these services and even local CSAs that will help a farmer stay in business. I also looked a Thrive Market. Their shipments are delayed 1-2 weeks but still taking orders.  A lot of these services have coupon codes too. A last resort for me would be the dinner box kits. There are tons of intro offers for these on Groupon.,False
