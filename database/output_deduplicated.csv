I'm agreeing that a fetus/baby is not a woman's body. I do think however that the reasons for abortion are not as simple as not wanting morning sickness. Just like the reasons a man would want a paper abortion ultimately vary. Regardless,False
I believe abortion makes more sense when a female either got raped or her life is at risk. Now day's it's becomes more normalized. When when two people have sex with or without condoms or not using a contraceptive pill and she becomes pregnant it's both their responsibility to upbringing the child. Financial situation etc is just another excuse to abort the child.,False

This doesn't look like a success.... Regardless of whether she has a bf or not she is not interested. You should of dropped it and not insist that is creepy. She didn't even wanted to be friends so i don't see the point here. She probably just wanted another Instagram follower and hoped you won't bother her lol.,False
Its a success regardless because he tried. People are way too tied into results. Once he does this enough he will get there,False
It isnt success if trying is overridden by being creepy. Yes there is an effort but in a bad sense ,False
Asking to have coffee as friends is not unhealthy or insisting. Who knows how she felt about it. Clearly this is a starting point. Its better than not doing anything and sitting around wondering what wouldve happened. Yes this wasnt a good approach to it and I always think connecting with a girl on a human level must come first before asking them out,False
Look I am okay with trying cold approach that is good practice nothing wrong with that. However if you turn interactions to this it would not go anywhere and you mess up all the effort you put. You basically can cut it when you supposed to and don't leave other party in stress and don't waste time yourself. Simple as that. This is bad for both parties. Asking a coffee as a friend is just plain lie and both parties know about it. So let's pass that.,False
What part of it is creepy? He just did 2 questions. How is that insisting dude?,False
Yeah I mean trying and such as I said in my other response is good practice and definitely confident booster. However being pushy just spoils that. It wastes further time for you and you can creep others. So not good. Well I haven't been there but If she has rejected him 2 times it doesn't sound like she been comfortable. If she has boyfriend you as stranger pretty much have what to talk her about? She isn't interested romantically which she mentioned. So then you turn and say as friend 1) that looks needy. 2) no one ever would believe that after that point even if you changed your mind. She would always question your intentions hence she plain rejected that option too. Then finally somehow she gave ig which is low risk. She can block him if she wants to. Plus girls care a lot about Instagram followers these days ( lame but true ). Anyway OP try what you trying ( cold approach ) but be sensible on people's boundaries please.,False

My question is if theyre thinking about getting rid of the edtpa this year. I dont know how or why they would keep it since just about every school if not all are closed so how would we be able to even complete it if we cant student teach? It makes no sense to me as to why they would keep it.,False

They want to believe theyre worth something,False
I think there was one study about the dna of a womans son being retained inside her body or something? Dont quote me on that but maybe thats what the refer to. Either way its bull,False
I wonder if a woman is still psycho if shes with a large number of men (in their opinion) and they use condoms every time so no sperm enters into her body? Or does it change the DNA some other way that would work with their narrative instead in that case?,False

Must wear Binoculars on top of goggles on top of sunglasses on top of prescription glasses,False
If you feel creepy break it. If it feels mutual don't break it.,False
Mirroring the other persons intensity of eye contact is pro-social. Too much eye contact when they arent doing it is read as intimidating and puts the other person on defense. Too little when theyre doing more than you and its read as anxious and low self-esteem. Mirror the other person in all social signaling and youll be golden (I.e. crossing legs,False
supposedly most humans naturally break eye contact every 3 seconds or so in order to not appear threatening so thats probably why it appears creepy,False
When youre trying to maintain prolonged eye contact,False

Holding unnatural eye contact IS creepy. Honestly when people do that to me I stop talking bc it's distracting. If a person chimes in with a noise of understanding (yup,False

I would interject. When people encounter any conflict they often consider the person who brought it up the person who caused it. When you bring it up itll make you be seen as the cause of the drama for bringing it up shielding the victim of the behaviour from backlash for defending herself.

Im not sure if Im looking at this too simplistically but its often touted that the legal system and laws are part of the patriarchy. Ive heard several times before that these laws are written and often enforced by men for their benefit. In spite of this there is disparity between the sentencing of men and women in federal causes. [Source](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2144002),False
I think you need to be more specific. All human societies which have left any enduring record have been patriarchies in the anthropological sense (with a handful of marginal cases that are more egalitarian but not clearly non-patriarchal). That is,False

I think men and women are far more similar than both MRAs and Feminists portrayI see a lot of posts explaining how men and women are so different and so thats why its so difficult for them to understand each other. I think men and women have very few fundamental differences. Yes,False
I guess so,False
"There are barely any differences at all in the brain but most males dont accept because """"muh physical strength/muh bible"""" or they bitch about """"whamen emotional"""" and more feminists dont care because of fbi statistics and the double standards that exist that were put in place by males.""",False
I genuinely don't understand hypergamy as a negative construct. I have never met a person who said that when looking for a partner,False

Are you familiar with [the patriarchal bargain](https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Patriarchal_bargain)?,False
When youre stuck inside patriarchy participating in it can protect you and reward you in some limited ways. Women sometimes laugh at sexist jokes because challenging them would be socially dangerous and sometimes physically dangerous. Women sometimes support abusers over victims because those abusers hold more social capital than their victims. This is an extreme example but consider Harvey Weinstein - the few women who did report him early on lost their careers because of the power he held in the film industry. Other actresses who *definitely* were aware of his behavior continued to work with him because if they also spoke out about it theyd be blacklisted as well.

What behaviors should a wife do but not a girlfriend as to not give too much to a man who hasnt fully committed to her yet?

Need the Truth20 M virgin. Im a pretty good looking guy. Had a good amount of opportunities in high school to have sex but never sealed the deal because I was to stupid to realize it,False
When you find the right girl it wont matter. Ive had a few girls be turned off and ghost me when they found out I was a virgin. I still am at 22. Some girls just straight up say that they dont wanna mess with virgins. I dont really see how its that big of an issue but I try to not worry about it anymore cuz Ill find the right girl. For hookups it would make sense but if a girl is looking for a relationship then she shouldnt care.,False
Yeah but I want to get this off my back ASAP. Forgot to mention I have received oral if that matters,False
Truth be told,False
Bad idea,False
Truth is your insecurities will hurt you more than being a virgin will. If you're secure about being a virgin and you don't make it a big deal,False

What the actual fuck is wrong with this chick.

This reminds me of the woman who went undercover as a man to prove that men are toxic and joined a bowling league and was shocked when she was welcomed and treated kindly even after she revealed herself to be a woman. I swear these dumbasses are wilfully living in a fantastical hellish nightmare world of their own creation just to play the victim.,True

That is what I am thinking as well,False
I'm confused,False
What the fuck is happening in this,False
I think I get it. A woman and an incel are at a restaurant at two different tables then she orders wine. The incel ask to get the same type and she looks at him. He gets all flustered and is on like Twitter or something. She then leaves and then the we get to the last panel.,False
I think I cracked the code. The incel is at dinner and sees a beautiful woman. He asks the waiter to send her a glass of wine. The woman accepts the glass of wine and at the end of her meal she leaves without offering herself to him. Hes mad and chases after her and demands sex in return for the wine he bought her.,False

Its beauty.,False
So you want to kill yourself because you love beauty ? If so,False
Theres a lot going on in your post. You say you were off and on the first year maybe thats why he feels like its too soon? Guys like to test relationship out not in a bad way but just to see if it will last. For example my boyfriend just recently started to tell his family about me even though weve been dating for 2 years and I completely understand that it takes time to vet a potential spouse. Also are you withholding sex because you feel like it will give you more power or an upper hand the the relationship? If so then thats the wrong move sex isnt something you give your partner is something you do WITH your partner and if you plan on not having sex when you previous were then it should be a discussion with him.,False

You right that can put u in the wrong place but i have to say this not every girl the same some u have to move directly to the relationship zone others it would be better to be in the FZ first and that cool guy is because he already build a reputation of being that cool with girls. Think about him im sure he has alot of friends that are girls and boys he usually never alone its not because he is cool that he is never alone or never with one girl its actually the opposite he is cool because he is never alone and usually not with one girl with him. Its just a himan nature when u see many people trying to get something or being around someone its just get us to think that thing or person must be great or cool for those many people to want him.,False
Thats a great point actually im glade someone did say that. But about that statement i think it sould hold true for some of the guys here that only want one night thing or just sex.

Men don't approach anymore ...I hear this quite often by women complaining they don't get approached and it begs the question: are men that bad today? The reason why a man will not approach women is because he had negative past experiences. He has tried several times and failed which makes him even less reluctant to make the next move. I firmly believe this explains why the majority of men don't approach anymore.,False
