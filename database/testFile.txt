"(with .for.insta) ... Today is the second anniversary of the viral hashtag In the last two years so many people have stood up in their own ways to declare themselves apart of the community of million of survivors of sexual violence, including sexual harassment, causing the rest of the world to finally pay attention to this public health crisis. As we move further into the election season in the U.S. we have watched the candidates elevate a number of issues that deserve attention but we have NOT heard what their plans are to deal with SEXUAL VIOLENCE both in prevention and for those who have already experienced harm. We have not seen it raised in debates or town halls or in media discussions. Tonight, on the anniversary of the hashtag please join us in watching the Presidential debates and sharing your concerns on social media using the and Let the candidates know what you want them to address in relation to sexual violence.",1

They have hobbies. They arent monsters that only come out at night. Theyre someones brother, mother, cousin, spouse, boss, nanny, friend, or doctor. Lets reframe the narrative that abusers are only capable of abuse. Because we all know theyre capable of having regular lives too.",1

""I REFUSE TO BECOME WHAT YOU CALL NORMAL"" ""BROKEN ISN'T BAD"" ""HUMAN"" All In all this picture is whole. Every text in this is complete. Every small phrase. Why is a naked girl body showcased here by a line art? And text on her arms and thighs that she is unique. And she is proud of herself. Why are we normalising perfect bodies? Why are we normalising thin Disney like waists, over fair skin and big eyes, slender neck and a sleek nose? Why do we judge people, here, girls, who are ""fat"" (finger quotes), who have a waist size over 40,who are ""dark"", have a big round nose and who wear clothes that she likes, and not the ""society"". And that is, a trend, a big BIG trend, for over so many years now. WHY ARE WE NORMALISING BODY SHAMING. WHY ARE WE NORMALISING SLUT SHAMING. WHY ARE WE NORMALISING IGNORANCE FOR GIRLS WHO STAND AGAINST THESE SHITS. I don't know rest, but every second NORMAL girl goes through this. Body shaming. Slut shaming. In school. I was. Many I know were. And we didn't say anything. I was dumb who stayed quiet all this time. I was dumb who thought it was good to ignore such ill minded people. Let them laugh over the size of my body, let them make fun of how I look. Let them speak shit about me every fucking time. I never said anything. I was dumb. I should have said that. But I didn't and I regret that. Just because I didn't say anything to those sexually shaming bullies then, that might ve made them say same or even worse about / to other girls I may or may not know. This...is something very near to a breakdown. This is something like...""God,why?"" I heard them daily. Passing such cheap comments and I was always quiet about it. I hate myself for that. But now I am not. I am saying this on my public account. Yes, those animals can see it too, and can laugh it off by again calling me slut and what not.

"EXCITING ANNOUNCEMENT Laura Bates is back again with her new book, MEN WHO HATE WOMEN. For over a year has immersed herself in a terrifying and shocking world of violence and hatred that is actively and directly causing mass murders of women. In this ground-breaking investigation, Laura traces the roots of extreme misogyny across a complex network of online groups extending from Men's Rights Activists and Pick up Artists to Men Going their Own Way, Trolls and the Incel movement, in the name of which some men have committed terrorist acts. Seeing boys and men groomed and radicalised to adopt an extreme and misogynistic mindset, Laura has spent months drawing parallels with other extremist movements around the world, seeking to understand what attracts men and boys to the movement, how it operates and considers what can be done. Most urgently of all, Laura traces the pathways this extreme ideology has taken from the darkest corners of the internet to emerge covertly in our mainstream media, our playgrounds and even our parliament.

"Priyanka Chopra Jonas might be a woman of steel but like everyone else, she's human too. Her struggles are for real and in the last 18 years, the actress has battled several ills in the industry to make it to the top. Today, with one foot in Bollywood and another firmly positioned in Hollywood, she's ruling the roost and how. But it wasn't anything short of a bumpy ride for her. From fighting racism in the West as a teenager to sexism here in Bollywood where PC claims she was called 'replaceable' and was thrown out of several films, Priyanka has come a long way. Talking about her entire journey, she also adds that she doesn't want to come across as a victim and it shows. Watch the full video to find out. . . . . . .",1

It was beautiful and in a growing neighborhood. Yet, they tore it down. I even walked around it while they were tearing it down. I felt like I had beaten the demons that were born there. There was triumph in the midst of that destruction. However, the destruction that was left in me still exists today. I have a heart damaged by abuse that started when I was a child. Through a fucked version of religion I was taught to blame myself for what was done to me. Taught that I was damaged goods. I still feel that way most days. I post this to say I am still here.

"This week we are talking about women's sexual health, as it is an important but very taboo part of women's overall wellbeing. While we normally have no problem talking about sexual health in terms of men, thinking about sexual health for women still seems to require a lot of sensitivity. so before we dive into all that fun stuff, we first need to talk about another important thing women face with their sexual health- slut shaming.     As women, we seem to teeter in this fine line of ""if you're not giving it up you're a prude, but if you are you're a slut"". What about just letting women do their thing safely and happily? Giving women the permission to love themselves in such an intimate manner. How can women truly explore their sexual health if they're too ashamed to talk about it in the first place. We need to empower one another and provide a safe space to talk about sex for women. So this week while we focus on intimacy and sexual health, we also encourage you to look at your own relationship with yourself around your body image, and thoughts of yourself in relation to sexual health. Let's make it okay to learn about sex & intimacy.   ",0

"[ - ] The tragedy started when I bought costume in the US. If you google you can find.. . So yeah, our costume was short but that doesn't justify all the sexual harassment we got here. I assure you I can tell the difference between complimenting vs harassing. (I mean, aren't we all, ladies.) I tried to just ignore it, as we came to have fun and you know I am pretty understanding of drunk people. But that French guy saying ""Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?"" totally brought back my worst memories in as an exchange student. I am not tokenizing all guys, and that's not the point of this posting. I want to say if you are an Asian girl traveling to countries with smaller Asian populations, prepare your own one liner. If you get harassed unexpectedly and do nothing, your brain will explode with thoughts like I should've said this, I should've said that. Although I am having fun, that moment is played over and over back of my brain, thinking what would've been the best reaction for them not to think they can do that to Asian women. So if you don't want to ruin the whole trip because of some jerks, it's good to prepare your own one liner for the worst case. And as a person who traveled to 24 countries and 56 cities in Europe, I can tell you, with a 99% chance you will thank me and yourself being prepared. My line is ""Get educated"" from now on. And with this posting, I will forget everything and enjoy the rest of my trip.  .                 .            .         .            .  ,          .

"Today is the 50th Anniversary of Stonewall. In a piece for It is commonly known that started with the 1969 Stonewall Inn Riots against police brutality. What is often left out of this narrative is that it was spearheaded by two transgender sex workers of colorMarsha P. Johnson & Sylvia Rivera. According to the Global Network of Sex Work Projects (NSWP), the Stonewall Inn was commonly raided by the police because it was a notorious hangout for sex workers, trans people of color & other marginalized people.  Following the riot, Johnson & Rivera co-founded the organization Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries, a group dedicated to helping homeless young drag queens & trans women of color. Both of their lives were dedicated to fighting for equal rights through any means necessary.  Although she had spearheaded of the movement, Rivera had to fight to speak during a 1973 pride rally because, as Melinda Chateauvert writes in her book Sex Workers Unite, The crowd did not want to hear from a transgender sex worker. Rivera & other sex workers joined Gay Liberation Front in an attempt to create a coalition of leftist queer folk. GLF fought for the sexual revolution & an anti-capitalist agenda to combat violence & discrimination against the LGBTQ community.  In Prostitution Papers, Kate Millet writes Prostitution, homosexuality & abortion are 3 instances where the law infringed upon sexual freedom. Bringing issues together to form umbrella groups for activism is often essential in creating the space for change, as well-known trans activist wrote in her book Outspoken Full article by  launched the Sex Worker Giving Circle with the dual goal of funding a diverse range of sex worker-led groups throughout the country & bringing current & former sex workers to the philanthropic decision-making table.

"The focus of this month for Jivamukti Yoga has been about silence through the exploration of this theme, at first I was thinking about how important it is that we take more time to be quiet, to be still, to say less. And then I thought about the flip side ~ when is silence... bad? There are times when we as individual people, community, society, or world are silent because we choose to stay comfortable than to speak for whats right. Watching and reading about all these horrible stories of women (mostly but not exclusively) being abused - whether physically sexually or otherwise by trusted leaders, famous singers, and even teachers in the yoga community that we look up to - and the world being silent about it for so long makes me stop and wonder. Some of the atrocities were just well hidden, yet some we knew of but just stayed idle in the hope that it would come to light on its own. And if we feel voiceless and powerless can we then hope that those in power will say and do whats right? Im not so sure. We can only trust our own voice, and speak from a place of conviction with clarity and compassion.  Thoughts?!",0

"This was my ex-husband. I first discovered he was cheating on me with my bestfriend (ex) 7 yrs and 2 kids into our marriage. Before this happened to me, of course I swore if my husband ever cheated on me. I would leave him. And of course I thought about it. Even tried. But I didn't go far. He promised to stop. The affair ended with her. The cheating continued the rest of our 17 yr marriage. Sometimes he hide it better than other times. It's amazing what men can get away with when they have money, control and power. People often assume that if a man is cheating on his wife it's because they are not getting any sex from their wife. That's not true. Not with men like this. My ex-husband and I had sex on a regular basis. I wasn't allowed to say no. It was my wifely duty. It was a unspoken rule between us. The first time I resisted was on our honeymoon. I learned that night. Sexual abuse occurs regularly as a part of domestic abuse, it's just rarely discussed. There is so much shame with each topic individual, nevermind together. No still means no. Anything other than yes means no. Because it's not always possible to say no but it's damn obvious that you're not saying yes. That's sexual abuse. Which is domestic abuse.

The petition also wants the reference book to broaden its scope by including examples representative of minorities like transgender women and lesbian women. In response, Oxford University Press says offensive or derogatory words widely used in English will not be excluded just because they are offensive or derogatory, but that part of the descriptive process is to make a words offensive status clear in the dictionarys treatment.",0

"Celebrating today! . . . . ""To say the last couple of weeks around here have been intense, would be an understatement.  Has anyone else felt like this September didn't feel like a *normal* September? Instead of nestling into a cozy new routine our has felt swift, transformational, and full of discomfort and lots of learning. But all of it is teaching us and we are actively listening.   Last week we installed our very first piece of REAL food manufacturing equipment at our newest social enterprise bakery, an organization called Stone Hearth Bakery in Halifax, NS. This packaging line will be an epic timesaver and also change the look/feel of our packaging (which I admittedly have slightly mixed feelings about...but more on that later).   With these investments we are building the capacity and skills capabilities of our social enterprise partners as we all 'level up' together. Committing to growing in partnership with social enterprises as manufacturing partners is an innovative model and really we've seen, there's no existing roadmap.   It's challenging and exhilarating and seeing the impact that our partnerships have on these community-led organizations reminds that I have no interest in building this purpose-led company in any other way. Because our food's more than about the food.   We've got social impact, baked-in.""",0

"Time to celebrate! After what has felt like forever ( 4 years!) The article I've been writing for has finally been submitted and submitted for pre-print. . . . I'm so proud of this achievement personally because it's been something I've been working on, on and off through bouts of illness, in between various jobs and navigating through time differences. . . . I can't tell you much about it till it's actually published but it's part of a research project into (FGS) We've also learned that this paper will be able to be citing for future funding opportunities for Bright. . . . Schistosomiasis is the second most prevalent parasitic infection after malaria. It's treatment is quick, cheap and easy but it's still horribly neglected and FGS especially has been largely ignored and unknow. One can't help but wonder if this is because it affects women, and specifically women in poverty. . . . Hopefully my paper will put a dent in the education needed for healthcare staff to provide for their patients. Thank you to all my co-authors and my supervisor whose help has been invaluable and support has been amazing in moving this forward. ",0

"It's kind of like how written throughout religious, governmental, and corporate founding documents is the word ""man.""   And even though when ""All men are created equal"" was written it was intended to leave out women (and all other persons who weren't white men), we're now meant to just accept that women, etc. is implied.   I can't imagine what would happen if we made all of those default nouns feminine, what effects, great and small, it would have on all the people reading, studying, and worshipping those words.   ",0
"Last night Mr Handmade came home from work and got a text asking if he wanted to go out to play to watch the football. I could sense the fear akin to a mouse that knows he's about to become dinner for a bird of prey as he asked if I minded. In my best ""wife to be"" impression I said ""no, of course"". Silently adding on ""you've had a tough old 24 hours at work and I'm sure you're exhausted from me doing the housework, cooking, food shopping, working my own 20 hour a week job, completing Etsy orders and getting up eleventy billion times a night with a poorly 1 year old do so you go out and let your hair down"". I thought it was best that I added that bit silently. Secretly I didn't give two shits because I immediately had visions of a large glass of wine, my feet up, complete silence and control of the tv remote. Happy days. He followed up with ""okay, just wanted to make sure because I'm not sure what your plans for tonight are"". Plans? Me? Well I was going to get my hair did, new nails and rock the shiz out of London Town til dawn downing Bollinger like a dehydrated camel but unfortunately Beyonc and Gigi Hadid already have plans so.... Plans. Really. I haven't had plans since 2015. I don't think you can consider sitting in my dressing gown in a front room covered with a skip full of baby crap all over the floor whilst watching the same Only Fools And Horses rerun that I've seen 9472640 times whilst staring at Facebook plans. But whatever. So off he went with a hop, skip and a jump to play with his friend like a merry sandboy. And me? Well, by 8pm Baby Handmade had been sick over his cot, choked on phlegm, cried his eyes out and would only settle on Mummy in Mummy's bed. So I laid there on the bed. In the dark. Dying for a drink and feeling like my bladder was having a rave up of it's own until he finally drifted off to sleep about 2 hours later. Then I went on Facebook. There must have been a lot of extra time on the football thing because Mr didn't come home until 1am .

"Rp MEAT IS MURDER  . Just some pink puppers playing in the water - Take this opportunity to reflect, and please ask yourself, ""Why do most of us believe it's okay to eat pigs, chickens, and cows, but not dogs and cats?"" All of these animals are sentient beings. All of these animals have emotions and feelings. And, most importantly, all of these animals want to be alive.  When we're new to the world and see farm animals for the first time, our initial instinct isn't to eat them; it's to pet them. Only through the repetitive teaching to view some animals as ""companion"" animals and others as ""food"" animals do we separate pigs, chickens, and cows from dogs and cats. This idea that some animals' lives matter more than others becomes engrained into our brains, but we can unlearn it if we try.  ""The idea that some lives matter less is the root of all that's wrong with the world."" -Paul Farmer -",0

". Living in nyc this summer nearly every day, on the street or the subway, I was harrassed just for being a woman. I would often see other woman get harassed aswell. It's a lose-lose if a woman makes eye contact, or stands up for herself the losers that make women uncomfortable follow you, turn around, cuss you out, spit on you, star even more, try and intimate you even more, the list goes on some even physically assault. If you ignore it, they have the satisfaction that they made you uncomfortable, and will continually think it's okay to harass . What is it with these men who think it's okay to do that? Its literally sickening and nauseating. We are not scared we are fed up! So ya, as vulgar as it is, my hope for this piece is share the discomfort, the nauseating feeling, and the physical discomfort of being harassed based on your anatomy with those who identify with men. It's not about rage, it's to hopefully help men realize what women feel when they get harassed. I do realize men do get harassed as well, but on a whole women are far more likely to experience it regularly. So stop, it if you do. We do not think its flattering for cat calls, you turning around for a double take, the constant staring, ""looking good baby"" ""you should smile"" etc. If you wouldnt say it to your sister or brother then dont. We want to live our lives feeling safe. Heck, that's what every woman and person deserves.",0

"Sahar Khodayari, commonly known as Irans Blue Girl, was arrested in March, after attempting to enter a football stadium, disguised as a man. She spent three days in prison, before being released on bail for six months. A week ago, in the courthouse, Khodyari overheard that she could face up to two years imprisonment for being seen in public without a hijab, and, as a result, she poured gasoline on herself, and set it alight. The Blue Girl later died in hospital, after 90% of her body was left with third degree burns, and she suffered serious lung damage. The activists death has led to outcry and grief; her favourite club (Esteghlal) published a statement mourning her death, and held a one minutes silence, while Philip Luther from Amnesty International declared the incident heartbreaking, explaining that the death highlighted the effect of Irans ""appalling contempt for women's rights"". - Liz . . . .",0

And was elected as the ""influenceur of the year"" by Cosmopolitain, in 2019 for a reason. I think she is a true model and an inspiration for many. At only 20 years old, she already has a big community and shares daily messages about how to love yourself, get ride of abbusive people in your life and how to not give a damn, about what other people may tell you. She also encourages women, by empowering them on their sexuallity, and how society as taught women that they should be ashamed of it. She is one of those women, that you look up too. She has a business at only 20, is someone always positive in what she shares, she fights for minorities, empowers people, and make them remember that they should never settle for something, that don't deserve them. She is also, a true fashion icon. She is part of the queer community, and share things about it, to show people that your sexuality is your choice, and that you should never be shamed for it. With everything she shares, she truly empowers people to love themselves, be themselves and being proud of it. We often talk about only following people, who inspire and empower you, to be the best verison of yourself and only make you feel good. Florence Given, is definitely one of them. xxZ",0

"Some BULLIES and SLUT-SHAMERS will go through entire lifetimes without ever realizing the amount of pain and damage they cause to those in the receiving end of their judgement, wicked-lies and verbal-diarrhea. They will continue to wear their ridiculous rationalisations on their sleeves and walk around entitled, feeding on the indignant silence of some of us. And some of us will be unable to shake off the hurt and the ignominy generated from their actions, well into our adulthoods despite having successful careers, supportive friends and families and productive social standings. An even smaller introvertish and self-aware section of us will continue to battle anxiety, depression and despair very quietly and in utter loneliness.

One of the ads, which was marketing Philadelphia cream cheese, was accused of reinforcing the idea that men were ineffective childcarers. The other was for Volkswagen and featured a woman sitting next to a pram in a stereotypical care-giving role. The ads were found to have broken new advertising rules designed to reduce gender stereotyping. Both companies have defended their ads. Philadelphia described it as a ""no-win situation,"" having chosen two dads to avoid the stereotypical image of two new mums handling childcare responsibilities, while Volkswagen said caring for a newborn was a life-changing experience, regardless of the parent's gender.

"But we dont need feminism anymore! they say, as UK deaths by domestic violence reach an all-time high, while over 49 million girls miss out on an education in Sub-Saharan Africa, and Saudi Arabian women cannot openly compete in sport, nor wear certain clothes. The idea that women are subordinate to men has been ingrained into society from the very start, and Im beginning to understand why more and more. Im currently reading Simone de Beauvoirs The Second Sex, and, while I have a lot to criticise about her as a person, as well as her writing, its becoming increasingly obvious that womans ability to give birth somehow made them inferior. That was largely because they could not fight nor hunt, as pregnancy effectively rendered them useless, and, once the child was born, the mother had to care for it, while the father fought, defended, or scavenged for food. What these primitives failed to realise was that the strength childbirth requires is absolutely immense, and the concept that women were merely weak, offspring-producing machines with little else about them was one that remained for centuries. - Liz . . .",0

"Women pull up the drawbridge when they get to the top, so-called Queen Bee behaviour Not only is it harder for women to reach the top roles, theres also a tendency to judge those women who do more harshly than their male counterparts. If a fault is found in a womans leadership, its often described as typical of her gender. Yet, if she performs well, its thought of as an exception! Theres also a stigma around women exhibiting Queen Bee behaviour when they get to the top and pulling the drawbridge up for other women to succeed by turning down requests for advice and mentoring from junior women. The simple truth is that theres fewer women at the top to help the many women lower down, and its simply not possible to help them all. Whilst helping other women may be a priority for lots of female leaders, we need to remember that they also have perform well at their own job  particularly given this greater scrutiny. . . .",0

This is disgusting misogyny and promotion of rape culture.,0
"Exactly one year ago today, Tuesday, October 16 at around I was assaulted and raped in my apartment. The fear, shame, self-hatred, depression and suicidal thoughts that accompany such a thing are indescribable. It didnt take long at all for me to reach the lowest point in my life. Too many nights, alone in the same apartment that the attack happened, I would find myself praying to God, asking Him to end my life, because I knew I couldnt bring myself to do it, but I just couldnt see any way to come back from such a thing. I. Hated. Me. Have you ever felt that way? I wanted to give up, but He wouldnt let me. He blessed me with an incredible support system of friends and family who listened to me scream and cry and doubt and hope, all in the same breath. Two months later, I decided enough was enough. God had been taking me on a journey of learning how to love myself for the last two years, and I finally decided that instead of letting this rape consume my life and define me, I was going to learn from it. I was going to grow from it. I was going to thrive. Shaving off my hair was the easiest and best decision ever. I knew I had nothing left to lose, but so much to gain, from letting go of all of my insecurities and hangups, and letting God really teach me how to love myself. Today, Im not perfect. There are days that I still look in the mirror and hate who and what I see. Im still insecure. But I love myself more today than I did last year. I love myself more today than I did yesterday. And I know God is more than satisfied with that.  If you have ever gone through anything like this, ever had thoughts like this, or just need someone to talk to - Im someone! I am here to listen, judgement free. I wont even offer any advice unless you ask. If you'd rather not talk to me, you can text ""HOME"" to 741741 to text with a trained crisis counselor, or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. Just know that you dont have to go through this alone; Id love to be there for you.",0

"Shannon Maley had a seeming vendetta against a 20-year-old man with learning disabilities who was dating her sister. She barely knew him, yet claimed he sexually assaulted her and her friends. Maley then created multiple social media accounts under the young mans name and sent herself disturbing and threatening messages in order to frame him. She has since pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice and also to harassing witnesses, The Daily Record, a UK news publication reports. The young man, who will not be named by because he is the victim and will instead be referred to as John Doe, told the Record he was on the brink of suicide until he was acquitted last November on five charges of sexual assault. The outlet reported that he sat on the ledge of his 14th-storey flat window seriously contemplating whether life was worth living because of the vicious lies that had destroyed him. Maleys messages to herself included threats to set you on fire and watch you burn alive and claims that John was not going to stop causing you pain. Maley had apparently intimidated her friends into making accusations against John as well. One of those friends eventually admitted that the young man had not sexually assaulted her and that Maley had harassed her and tried to influence their testimony at John's trial. John was also accused of sexually assaulting two 15-year-old girls who were also allegedly friends of Maley. A witness explained that John didnt do what he was accused of doing, leading to acquittal on those charges. Maleys story unraveled after she accused John of sending a threatening message while he was in prison without access to the Internet. No reason has been given for Maleys vendetta against John, and the young man still fears for his safety. ""It feels like Shannon Maley has destroyed my life. I still cant walk down the street without people shouting abuse at me, John said. Ive had voicemails from people I dont even know saying theyre going to blow up my house. Unfortunately, people believe what they see online and its a very dangerous situation. She's an absolute monster. I want to see her punished for ruining my life.""",0

"Stop calling me a nurse. Stop stereotyping on the basis of sex. Stop assuming the role of women in the workplace. Stop undermining my rights to have a career of my choice. Just stop.   Let me just tell you truthfully, there hasnt been a single day in the last two weeks that Ive been in the OR where I havent been called a nurse. The worse part is, when their curiosity gets deeper and they find out I am a surgical resident, the shock on their face is even more offensive. Dont get me wrong, I would be honored to be a nurse, its one of the most important and hardest jobs in healthcare so its not about being a nurse if I was one BUT I am not okay with the assumption that I AM a nurse simply based on my gender or perhaps the fact that I have my hair and make up done at 6 am that leads them to assume. Whatever it is that I am doing that makes me LOOK less like a doctor, is a stereotype in 2019 and it has GOT TO GO. Whether youre a doctor, PA, nurse, pharmacist or any other position in the hospital you should not be categorized based on your appearance. And this is where we ALL can make a when you see discrimination, of any kind, say something and leave a lasting impression. Heres what I mean, in dental school, I was called a hygienist all the time. I usually smiled, and said no I am a dentist and then moved on. I didnt feel like making a fuss about it would do anything. I was mostly silent and I allowed people to continue judging. NOW I no longer do that. When I am wrongly assumed to be something I am not and I feel its on the basis of gender, I smile, say something and then move on. My usually go to technique is sarcasm. The reason why I use humor in response to these stereotypes is because it is too subtle to cause scene but sharp enough to make a point. My mission isnt to fight with everyone, its to breakdown the barriers by first saying something and then eventually doing something. And guess what, everyone has a role to play whether youre a man or woman.",0

"Pssst... We are a week from Musings of a Fat, Black Muslim  hitting bookstore shelves, sent to your home, and just getting to see your beautiful faces at these events. People keep asking me how do I feel about all of this, ya know having my deep dark secrets out in full view? To be honest, as I am excited, I am equally terrified. There are topics in the book that Ive never shared with the public. And especially as a Muslim woman, we are to remain pure in the public eye. We are to be covered and devout and quiet and non-sexual. We are never to taint what the world views as a perfect practicing Hijabi. We arent afforded mistakes. But men get oh, boys will be boys and 99 excuses for their fuckery. One of the topics I cover is sexuality and virginity. I wont give anything away, but I was extremely uncomfortable writing some of these stories. I couldnt get out of my head, that Im going to hell for sharing these things as a Muslim woman. It has been etched into my head that Muslim women just dont explore or talk about sexuality, among other things. We are to stay naive. Even now, Im not sure how I will prepare myself for the onslaught of negativity that this topic in particular will get from the Muslim community. I cant stress this enough, Im not the poster child for Islam. Yes, Im Muslim but I dont speak for all Muslims. Nor are we one size fits all. Why do women have to play the pious virgin role in order to not be deemed as that kind of girl?

"Link in bio Remember the kind of political/societal excerpts we come across when we read books written by decent authors, the kind that no matter if written in the 1800's or 1700's are somehow still relevant. The sense of sadness, hopelessness and disgust they bring you. The kind that makes you want to go out and do something about the way society and politics work. You get all excited for some time but in the end you boil down to a realisation that if you go too deep and too honest, you might end up dead, just like Lankesh, Vemula and other unsung martyrs. So you calm the fuck down and let things be. I've been this person at times, at times not. I keep trying to muster up enough courage and speak up for things. It's just sad that this video might stay relevant for a long time in the history of women as well. So we've got to stay together in this fight, make regular minor changes and at times some major ones if you think you're standing for what's right. Shot and edited by my favorite",0

"Ive recently come to fully accept another part of my infinite my freakiness/sexuality. I honestly always had the freak streak in me and sometimes showed it but I found myself occasionally being ashamed of being public with it due to fear of others judgment. Friends, family members and strangers would question me or place judgment on things that werent really their business to begin with. (Go find my poem, my body is not your body.) With guys it always kills me because many of our fave artists are very sexual; Im sure Ferg aint the only one who want to eat Rih-rih like a panini, yet yall will slut-shame a girl you know from done the street if she expresses herself as a savage. Either way, as someone who experienced sexual trauma and had to personally deal with the guilt and pain that comes with it YEARS after, I realize now that I dont need to give two shits anymore lol. If Im a freak, a hoe, or a tease because I like to proudly show this temporary temple off then fuck it. Bite me  That being said I usually gladly share this side of myself with the person Im with. Although Im not with anyone this was written for one person in particular . I may or may not share with him lol ...but what you think?

Seems that we are using the term free for the wrong subjects. Free hatred. Free racism. Free sexism. Free speech is only used when we want to oppress someone but not as a shield against injustice. .... This image does not only talk about the movement it talks about our society nowadays. .... What are your thoughts when you see this post? It is fair that a company like that sexualize the womens bodies is ambassador of this movement?

"What is a ""thirst trap""..... The confidence of a woman in her sexual frequency and sharing that with the world..? Let's think about this for a second... The thirst is coming from the other person who is seeking to find something specific within that particular person right? They are thirsty for something.. Usually this saying is all around sex... However it could be deeper than that... which is usually always is... So let's address the word.. ""trap"".... The way this is stated is that the woman who is embodying her sexuality, sexiness, sensuality, and confidence thru her physical expression is only doing so to attract someone to her.. or.... lure him to her web... (Exhibition or validation.. an episode I'm working on for the show) The evil sexually empowered woman... (Lilith running thru me) ... CAUSING the man to take his eyes away from his current partner (witch wound and the illusion of ""mine"" is an upcoming episode on Rising Goddess Radio).. taking something from another and trapping it in her web of sexual prowess.... Slut.. Whore.. Skank.. Bitch.. ... interesting... So ultimately calling someone a ""thirst trap"" is another form of slut shaming, because you (proverbial you who is calling people this based off their choices of sexually empowered photos) are seeing something within them that triggers fear of loss.. OR... if you are the person who is ""thirsty""... calling this person who is trapping you with their thirst, the problem, and ultimately not having to take responsibility for the triggered emotions and thought processes and actions coming from that trigger.... ... interesting... What are your thoughts? Oh! And to summer... because I'm traveling back to Aurora in a week, and it's snowing... Soooo.... sunlight and warmth and string bikinis... Cause . . .",0

"""A woman is a full circle.

Discrimination against girls is rampant and due to fear of abuse and exploitation, they are kept at home and not sent to school. Child marriage is yet another glaring issue. It is a matter of great shame that cases of female infanticide are still reported. We want to be a part of a world where girls are celebrated, not just on festivals! Where they are treated equal, with live and respect. What is urgently required in society today is a change of attitude.",0

It has been really strange to be immersed in a world of violence and hatred that is actively and directly causing mass murders of women, to see boys being deliberately groomed and radicalised and to trace the ideology and messaging I was finding deep online right through our mainstream and media and into our politics and homes, all without much mainstream awareness at all that this is happening.

He proceeded to FINALLY put on protection and finish regardless of me not looking at him the entire time. I put it out of my mind thinking that I was overreacting and he didnt mean anything malicious by it. All that changed when I had learned he was telling my recent ex of a year that he had finally gotten what my ex had never had. I heard about it from multiple people and was so distraught.

"VENT INCOMING . . . Self censorship brought to you by Instagram, but truly enforced by societies fucked up ideals! Sometimes I feel absolutely invisible only up and to the point of objectification. Censorship takes a toll on your psych, on your physical wellbeing. As sex workers we are constantly excluded from conversations about our work and as human beings we are othered and aliened from general society. . . Even as said society worships our ideals, I find myself exhausted and run down more than I care to admit. Shame, stigma, fear, violence all of the destructive and abusive interactions can be boiled down to the fact that we do not allow ourselves to have a nuanced perspective on our own sexuality. We project! We Attack those we wish to emulate! I cant even count how many times I was taught and did enforce sexism and self censorship myself in my younger days. . . My sexuality and my body (nude or not) gives me strength, and power, and people seek out my time to bask in that energy. Constantly making me censor my own body only reminds me of how dangerous the world sees me. This fear allows them to take away our rights and demonize our actions while they continue to see us in private.

Her public denouncing of rape as comedic subject matter elevated her name into the national arena, if she liked it or not. It was at that time that I witnessed a peek into Lindy's world. She had just returned to Seattle from being invited to participate in a nationally televised debate on the matter. A debate that resulted instantly in rape, violence and death threats from faceless commenters. I will never forget how raw and resolute she was as she read them aloud to us that night. In that moment, I saw a Joan of Arch-type heroine in Lindy. I was so enamored with her strength and inspired by her defiance to be silenced.

MeToo started in 2006 and was working with Children of Color to give support after experiencing sexual violence. MeToo has been ongoing in the acts of supporting and speaking about her sexual violences. 98% of sexual violence are committed by men.

"Are you able to identify your strengths? Understanding your personal potential is essential to your success. If you cant identify your own strengths, its more difficult to identify new roles youd be a great fit for, or to explain at an interview why youd make a great asset to the team. A good starting point can be analysing your CV, although you need to go beyond this to articulate your potential. Heres a couple of questions to think about When you look at your achievements and you think about the way you went about securing those things, what does it tell you about what you do well? From those insights, what does that indicate are the most important aspects of your skills, knowledge, approach(es) that make the difference that you deliver? Whats your supporting evidence? Underpinning those achievements, in terms of delivering your role, what is it about your attitude, outlook and behaviours that made those outcomes possible? . . .",0

"If you cant convince yourself, you cant convince others Theres a lot of talk about confidence, but for a good its one of the most fundamentally significant concepts for women in the workplace. If you do not (at least) appear to have confidence in what you say, do, suggest or recommend, why should anyone else? Our 2019 survey results found that whilst 81.1% of women felt that always or mostly demonstrated external confidence, only 47% matched this with strong internal confidence. Whilst its brilliant that women are resilient enough to present a confident faade, some of their potential will undoubtably be lost due to this lack of self-belief. To change things we have to address the cause, not the symptoms. These internal confidence issues are caused by external biases which eclipse the truth about individual womens capability potential. By using psychological insights, we want to expose these limiting beliefs and enable all women to unlock their full potential. Is your internal confidence holding you back? . . .",0

"Jen & I will soon have our last words together on the podcast about sexual harassment in the media. I cant go on being triggered every time Weinstein/Lauer/Don Burke/Bill OReilly is mentioned. Im going to do say my bit and then its done. Im not hostage to this anymore. I want to remember 94 to 2000 as an era where I had red, ginger spice hair and the Rachel cut. Australias defamation laws are so weak because we should name every one of them but cant. Id do a total Kendal Roy (see clip) but someone would sue us. They can us mad witches but the thing is Jen & I worked together and suffered under the same culprits. I have mentally filed away the receipts. So heres to releasing pain and moving forward!",0

"// Follow Follow Slut - A word used by boys to describe a girl's character these days She wears short clothes, she is a slut! She is going for a late night party, she is a slut! She is talking with more than one guy, she is a slut! She is not a virgin, she is a slut! She is having more male friends, she is a slut! And now a days, even if a girl is wearing an off shoulder top, you guys label her as a slut! She is not a slut...Come on every one is having freedom to live.. Rather I should say that your minds are filled with dirt. Everytime when a girl decides to live her life in her own way, she is labelled as a slut by some knuckleheads. STOP THIS SLUT SHAMING Do you guys ever realise how bad a girl feels, when she is called a Slut? Just because she wanted to live her life freely? Life seems meaningless to her. She regrets being born as a girl. .I want you to know that you are beautiful no matter what others say to you. No one deserves to feel even for a second that they are worthless in this world. Never give anyone the ability to bring you down or allow you to think you are not good enough. Each and every one of us were placed on this Earth with a purpose...No one can heal themselves by wounding others. Our words must be used to encourage others, not destroy them. We do not know the struggles and hardships others may be experiencing. It is important to always be mindful of the feelings of others. Do not be afraid to be yourself because that is what makes you special. You can achieve anything you set your mind to. This is your life, it is up to you to paint it the way you would like it to be  So Dear Girls, Don't hold back your feelings and awesomeness just because of some cheap and mentally disturbed craps...Don't just walk away, just give them a tight slap give that person a nice lesson, lets your hands do the talking and at last just ask a question...Ghar meh maa behan nai hai kya ? // .

"Ok I missed a day of so here is a combination of kooky crafts for day 12 and cats for day 13. I started to think maybe I should warn people about the sweariness. But actually I dont have a problem with sweatiness. I love the word cunt. Its better when its used as a descriptor not a negative attack admittedly. So this week I will share some positive stuff about the word cunt in all its glory. And Im working on a post about my feelings about swearing too. You lucky fuckers! Anyway, this is silly and made me laugh. I loved Garfield as a kid and this is a lovely reimagining of an adult version. Thank you for creating it!",0

"Wow, this one really resonates. Having heard recent stories of blatant sexism at work still alive and well, this is just your friendly reminder NOT to let things slide. A casual reference to what you're wearing is NEVER OK. Challenging the status quo - even if it makes people squirm a bit - is GOOD. Saying no to something that a guy in the same role wouldn't be asked to do is THE RIGHT THING TO DO. I could go on... Be bold. Be brave. Don't be afraid.",0

"Reporting your abuser is a very scary decision. Its not for everyone. But if the reason thats holding you back from reporting is because youre worried about hurting your abuser, then I want you to know this. Youre not ruining their life. Abusing someone is a choice. Its a choice that should come with consequences just like any other action. Youre not ruining their reputation or destroying their friendships. If anything, youre letting others see that person for who they really are. You might even find others join you in saying . That was certainly the case for me. And despite what their supporters may say, what youre doing is incredibly brave. Youre helping yourself. Youre helping other survivors. And youre making your community safer. I reported my abuser twice. The first time I reported him, it went nowhere. The cops couldnt find enough evidence. This second time, for a different crime, has taught me these 3 things. He chose to hurt me. And hopefully, he wont hurt anyone else.",0
"is the same in every language, for every species, for every mama and her baby. In the dairy industry babies are forcefully and violently taken from their mothers upon being born every single day. Just like humans, female cows need to have babies to produce milk, they dont just produce milk naturally. When her baby gets taken away from her, a mama cows heart completely breaks, she will cry for it and mourn for it her baby will never get to drink the milk her body produced from her pregnancy even though that is what is natural to both of them. Its absolutely horrific how we exploit the natural birthing process of a female cow and her baby, just so we can drink her milk. Wake up world!! Please. This is so unnatural, cruel and horrific!! Dairy is !! Dairy is !! Cows milk is for baby cows NOT humans!!! Who do we think we are?? Animals are not here FOR us they are here WITH us. And if you think otherwise its time to grow up. - - -",0

"Heres an illustration By Imogen - In light of the recent 2 year anniversary of the . Everyday people are putting their hands up, Bravely telling their stories in hope that it might encourage others to share their experiences, by using the hashtag people are beginning to get a sense of the magnitude of the problem and it also gives victims a platform to speak openly and safely in hope that others will join the fight to end sexual violence. For some survivors telling their story is a radical act of healing if their reality has been denied or they have been conditioned to protect the feelings of another at the expense of there own. Survivors own their stories and with that they have the right to choose to withhold or share them The unfortunate truth is that most people who do come forward are subjected to further feelings of shame by being dismissed, their motives, actions questioned and worried that our untold stories will invite disapproval and victim blaming/shaming. Regardless of how our stories differ, our experiences are our own, we have all endures something that never should have happened to us, this is the connection we share. No matter what we will continue to believe all survivors- period. I see you & I believe you.",0

"Im with you.  Natasha // Upstate NY | Ive thought a lot about whether of not to post this story, but, I think its important. So, fuck it. Heres the story Natashas Photo. Natasha is my Godsister. I was visiting her and her family at their farm in upstate NY and one afternoon she and I were in a field, listening to music, shooting, talking and this moment happened - a young woman who was completely lost in her own world, not performing for any gaze, but rather, celebrating her womanhood and embracing her own power as a women. In 2016 I posted this image on Instagram. And it was censored. I was stunned, and then outraged, especially considering some of the imagery that shows up in my feed and in the discovery section. To each their own, but naked women posing for men are fine, but this image, this needs to be censored? It felt like Instagram was telling women that their bodies are shameful, unless they are being used for the purposes of male satisfaction and that their womanhood should not be celebrated. And I reposted the image saying just that. The image was removed again and my account was immediately blacklisted and buried in the algorithm. Overnight my account became invisible. Its been that way ever since. Now, I have never really put a whole lot of stock in the whole Insta fame world and I dont particularly care. However, Instagram is a publishing house now and like it or not, as a photographer a lot of my jobs come down to clients looking at my Instagram - brands will or will not hire you based on your follower count and interactions. So, Im calling you out Instagram. Im not the only one youve buried. And Im tired of you telling me what I want to see in my timeline, because your algorithm sucks. If I follow someone, I want to see their images, not the same 5 people and nobody else. Show me my damn friends and stop making women feel like only images a frat boy would wanna jerk off to is what the beauty standard of a woman should be.",0
